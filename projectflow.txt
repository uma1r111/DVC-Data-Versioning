1. Create git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create code_version.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
# pip install dvc
4. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push" -> *save version of data*
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11. Now make changes to code_version.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
